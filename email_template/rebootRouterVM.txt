Dear FIRSTNAME LASTNAME,
<P>
We will now reboot the virtual router VM that belongs to your domain <b>'ROUTERDOMAIN'</b> (ROUTERNAME).
<P>
If this router is actually routing traffic (instead of just DHCP/DNS), then during this reboot your VMs will have no network connectivity. Expected downtime is 1~3 minutes.
<P>
Please contact us in case of any problems.
<P>
Kind Regards,
<BR>
<BR>The IaaS Team.
